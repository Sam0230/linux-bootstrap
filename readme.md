### do not use any thing in this repo
my computer doesn't boot, and i don't have another one to make a live usb installer, so i created this repo on my phone.
it uses github actions to build a minimum bootable linux environment that consists only of a grub2 efi file, gzipped linux kernel and a busybox initramfs.
i'll copy these files to a usb disk with my phone and boot my computer from it.
